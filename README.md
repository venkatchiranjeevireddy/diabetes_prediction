# Diabetes Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic features such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure. Using machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes patient data and determines the likelihood of diabetes.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes medical records containing features such as:
- **Pregnancies** - Number of times the patient has been pregnant
- **Glucose** - Plasma glucose concentration
- **Blood Pressure** - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness** - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin** - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI** - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function** - Genetic risk indicator
- **Age** - Age of the patient
- **Outcome** - 0 (Non-diabetic) or 1 (Diabetic)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Selection** - Training multiple machine learning models including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. **Evaluation Metrics** - Models are evaluated based on:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📌 Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **90%**. 

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Some potential enhancements for this project:
- Use more advanced machine learning models like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
- Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for better generalization.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
